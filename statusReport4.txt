Name: Christopher Jones
Project Title: Tour Bus Dispatch Generator

Team Members: Christopher Jones

Overall Status: Developing prototype

Number of hours worked since last update: 10
Number of hours worked on the project thus far: 35
Total number of hours anticipated for completion:130

Accomplishments: 
Established better communication with the people I'm making this for. Got some feedback for the direction
I'm going, and got some more specific requirements from them. Got Google OR tools to assign vehicles
with time window constraints while also considering travel time between locations.
Also got OR tools to ensure vehicles only pick up one group at a time.


Challenges:
After talking to my people in Alaska, I've realized they want the final dispatch to display names of tours,
not just the locations. I'll need to figure out how to calculate that in the program.


Plans / Goals for next week:
Continue the prototype. Include vehicle capacity constraints in the algorithm. Explore wxPython gui to get an 
idea on how I'm going to make the user interface.


Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?)
Work for 2 hours per day for 5 days out of the week. If a miss a day make up for it on Saturday.


Other comments:
Talking to my people in alaska, I realize that to make this work it's going to need to be very customized
to their business. I probably won't be able to make an app that can be universally effective for any tour 
company unless I start a completely different project later.
