Project Title: Tour Bus Dispatch Generator

Team Members: Christopher Jones

Overall Status: Working on UI

Number of hours worked since last update: 10
Number of hours worked on the project thus far: 75
Total number of hours anticipated for completion: 130

Accomplishments:
I created the new distance matrix in Excel. This took a lot of time because I had to add several locations
that I didn't have before. I sent the new matrix to my client, got their feedback, made some adjustments
and got it approved. I started working on some Excel formulas to make input easier.

Challenges:
The people I'm working with are kind of slow to respond. It took all week just to get the new matrix approved.

Plans / Goals for next week:
Now that the distance matrix is finished I need to make the program read it from the file, rather than from inside
the code. I also need to finish the Excel formulas to make input easier, and adjust the program to read from
the Excel files in the new format structure.


Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?)
Work for 2 hours per day for 5 days out of the week. If a miss a day make up for it on Saturday.
