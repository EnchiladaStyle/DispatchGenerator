Accomplishments:
I studied into SQLite and I created a system in the software to parse data from the excel template file and save it to a database

Challenges:
I haven't worked with SQLite before, so it took some research before I was confident putting it into the application.

Plans / Goals for next week:
Finish putting together SQLite functionality to take data from database and use it to populate an excel file.
Start putting together the final draft of the UI.


Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?)
Work for 2 hours per day for 5 days out of the week. If a miss a day make up for it on Saturday.
