I Finished adding excel formulas that will auto populate cells with locations and travel times based on input the 
user can copy and paste from the cruise ship request. I wrote the logic to enable the program to read from the excel
file to format the data to go into the algorithm.

Some of what I did this week was working in the prototype but needed to be changed a lot to work with the new template structure.

Learn more about SQLite and come up with a plan to save templates. Start working on this functionality
